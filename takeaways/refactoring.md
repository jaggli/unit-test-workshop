# Code Smells
- The code works but has flaws (smells) so we have to refactor it
- List of [JS smells](http://elijahmanor.com/javascript-smells/)

### Comments
- If you need a **comment** to explain your code, it's a smell
- Good code is self explanatory
- Generator comments are ok
- Use functions instead of comments, even if they're only used once, locally

### Duplicated code
- Doing the same thing slightly different and copy the code, this is duplicated code
